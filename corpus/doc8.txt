Natural language processing (NLP) aims at investigating the interactions between agents and humans, processing and analyzing large amounts of natural language data. In recent years, for attaining better performance and handling large corpora, building large‑scale language models is an inevitable trend in real applications. Despite the success of language models in various domains, the explainability and complexity of language models have drawn intense research interests recently. In order to make models explainable and lightweight, integrating models with symbolic domain models and planning methods is a promising approach. In this paper, we first introduce some background knowledge in AI planning and natural language processing as well as their relations. Then we give a comprehensive overview of integrating AI planning and natural language processing by four aspects and their challenges: planning‑based text understanding, planning‑based natural language processing, planning‑based explainability, and text‑based human‑robot interaction.
