Recent improvements in machine learning have been driven by larger, more data-intensive models. Building on this trend, we introduce a generative preâ€‘training approach that adapts a Transformer-based architecture to language understanding tasks. In contrast to traditional discriminative models, our method trains a language model on a vast corpus of unlabeled text and then fine-tunes it on downstream tasks. We show that this simple two-stage process significantly improves performance on benchmarks like the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) and the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD). Our model architecture uses transformer blocks, residual connections, and layer normalization. During training, the objective is to predict the next token given all preceding tokens. Fine-tuning adapts the model by adding task-specific output layers and minimal parameter updates. This approach yields substantial gains with minimal architecture modifications.
